# Audit-Programs
# Open Source Audit Programs #

In an era where it is very much a possibility to run a business on open source software, this project hopes to do the same for audit/assurance programs.  My hope is that users will take, use and subsequently update the audit/assurance programs so that they (a) become more comprehensive and (b) remain up-to-date over time and (c) a more complete library is built up over time.

The audit/assurance programs are provided "as is".  There is no guarantee that they will identify all risks.  Further, developers canâ€™t accept responsibility for their misuse, abuse etc.  By using the audit/assurance programs the user agrees to indemnify the developers from any loss, expense, harm etc.
